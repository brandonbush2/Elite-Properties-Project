    "The provided features in the dataset have significant relevance in predicting the sale prices of residential properties. The number of bedrooms and bathrooms provides insights into the property's size and functionality, which are crucial factors influencing its value. The square footage of the living space provides an indication of the overall spaciousness and potential use of the property, impacting its desirability and pricing. The number of floors reflects the property's layout and can affect its appeal to potential buyers.\n",
