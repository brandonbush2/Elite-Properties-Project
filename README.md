# Data Understanding
To support their operations and decision-making processes, Elite Properties Group collects and analyzes various data related to the real estate market and property transactions. This data includes:
* Saleprice
* Number of Bedrooms
* Number of Bathrooms
* Year Built
* Date the house was sold
* Whether the house is on a waterfront
* Square footage of living space in the home
* Number of floors (levels) in house
* Quality of view from house

## Relevance of these features:
* **Saleprice:** This is the target variable, and it is of utmost importance as it represents the ultimate measure of a property's value. Predicting the sale price accurately is the primary objective of the project.
* **Number of Bedrooms:** The number of bedrooms is highly relevant for Elite Properties as it directly influences the size and functionality of the property. It is typically a significant factor in determining the value and desirability of a home.
* **Number of Bathrooms:** Similar to the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms is crucial for Elite Properties. It affects the convenience and comfort of residents, making properties with more bathrooms more attractive to potential buyers and potentially commanding higher sale prices.
* **Year Built:** The year a property was built provides important information about its age and potential condition. Elite Properties can consider the year built as a relevant feature as it can influence the perception of quality, maintenance requirements, and historical significance of a property.
* **Date the House Was Sold:** While the date of sale may not directly impact the predictive model, Elite Properties can use it for additional analysis, such as identifying seasonal trends or market fluctuations that may affect sale prices.
* **Whether the House Is on a Waterfront:** This feature is highly relevant for Elite Properties, especially if they specialize in waterfront or water-view properties. Being on a waterfront can significantly impact a property's value due to the premium associated with scenic views and direct access to water amenities.
* **Square Footage of Living Space:** The square footage of the living space is a key determinant of a property's size and functionality. Elite Properties can consider it as a significant feature, as larger living spaces often command higher sale prices.
* **Number of Floors (Levels) in the House:** The number of floors indicates the vertical layout of a property and can influence its overall appeal and functionality. Properties with multiple floors may be considered more desirable and can potentially have higher sale prices.
* **Quality of View from the House:** The quality of the view from a property, such as scenic landscapes or city skylines, can significantly impact its value. Elite Properties can consider this feature relevant, particularly if they deal with properties that offer exceptional views.
